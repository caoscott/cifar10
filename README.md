CIFAR-10 is a standard object recognition dataset with:
* 60,000 32x32 color images
* 10 object classes - 6000 images per class. 
* 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.  

Current state-of-the-art test accuracy on CIFAR-10 is around 95%.  

This is my submission for [Kaggle's CIFAR-10 Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cifar-10).  
I modified a ResNet-34 architecture from PyTorch and trained for around 200 epochs.  
The model achieved a test accuracy of 92.48% on Kaggle.
